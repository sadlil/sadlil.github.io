      <description>Last time i heard the word deadlock i was in college. I read the definition of deadlock in text books. I was so lucky or who knows may be careful that i didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter deadlock until now.
So lets go, remember the old days by remembering the definition again -
 A deadlock is a situation where two different programs or processes depend on one another for completion, either because both are using the same resources or because of erroneous cues or other problems.</description>
