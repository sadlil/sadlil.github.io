In few words I am - <div style="margin-left:2%">

</div>

I have been writing codes full time in __**Golang**__ from 2015. Sometimes also
use other languages like __**C, C++, Java, PHP and Javascript**__.
Instead of HTTP REST I like to work with **gRPC** Now. I Try to design my APIs
in gRPC now where I can. Its robust performance and scalability amuses me.
Years ago I worked with **Grails, Laravel 5 and Spring 3** frameworks.
Not in touch with these for a long time though, because I work with
awesome Go now. :)

I have used **MySQL/MariaDB**, **Postgres**; But really really in love with
**ElasticSearch**. Recently learned about **Presto**, It is fun.<br>

Likes to stream out data between services with **Kafka** or **SQS**. Gives me power
to have scaleable and reliable services.

I love to deploy things in **Kubernetes** by containerizing them with **docker**.
Monitoring them with **Prometheus and Grafana**. Loadbalance with **HAProxy**.
I Love to play with Kubernetes, Provision kube clusters in **aws, google cloud**.

I believe in testing, I try my best cover things under **unit tests, e2e tests and
integration tests**. I like to use CI/CD pipeline with **Jenkins**.

I like to have Scaling and Performance in mind. Love **HAProxy** to do some heavy lifting
for me.

I also do love **Open Sourcing**. I am contributor to **Kubernetes, gRPC** and some other
Open Source projects. I would still love to contribute more in the community.
